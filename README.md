Musical Chord Recognition Using Neural Networks

My Diploma Project

This project creates an automatic system based on neural networks using Matlab that can detect 
chords from musical samples, with a restrained application on music played on guitar. The targets of 
the project are:
-to describe the concept of Artificial Intelligence and the structure of a neural network
-to present the main aspects of audio processing
-to develop a relevant method of feature extraction from a signal
-to develop a method of chord partition of an audio file
-to choose an optimal neural network architecture and to adjust it to the chord recognition 
system
-to train the neural network with a large database of guitar chords
18
-to test the software with a script that inputs audio files recorded on a guitar and to test 
the efficiency of the system

Original contributions

The substantial theoretical research that further played a major role in successfully finalizing 
the experiments, along with the experimental results establish the contributions of the author. These 
contributions are:
• Implementation of the Constant-Q Transformation through a function that represents the 
evolution of frequencies in time from an audio signal.

• Extracting a chroma feature, based on the CQT, that identifies the musical chords from an 
audio file.
• Research into the onset detection methods known in literature and development of an 
appropriate function.
• Choosing an appropriate artificial neural network structure and adjusting its parameters to 
the project requirements.
• Realizing the audio recordings, with the support of a performing guitar artist, through an 
audio interface and creating a personal database of audio samples.
• Developing of a test script that facilitated the achievements of the experiments and reaching 
to some conclusions regarding each step of the project, how can it be further improved and 
what may be some causes of errors
